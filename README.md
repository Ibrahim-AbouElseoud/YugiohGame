# YugiohGame
The Popular card based game "Yu-gi-oh" made with Java from GUI to Engine for an Object Oriented Programming course.

General instructions to play:
1) you must draw a card 1st before you can do anything
2) you must end your draw phase (be in main phase) with end phase button
3) In order to attack you must be in the Battle phase and you click your own monster to initiate an attack
4) you can then end your phase if you want to put some monsters or spell cards (via end phase) or you could just end a turn (via end turn) 
5) Other player should now start his turn so pass the device to the other player
